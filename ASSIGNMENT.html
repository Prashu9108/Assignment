        <h2>Ancient India </h2>
        <p>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_sapiens" target="_blank">Homo sapiens</a>, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.<sup>[27][28][29]</sup> The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.<sup>[27]</sup> After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehrgarh" target="_blank">Mehrgarh</a> and other sites in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balochistan,_Pakistan" target="_blank">Balochistan, Pakistan</a> .<sup>[83]</sup> These gradually developed into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilisation" target="_blank">Indus Valley Civilisation</a> ,<sup>[84][83]</sup> the first urban culture in South Asia,<sup>[85]</sup> which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India.<sup>[86]</sup> Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.<sup>[85]</sup></p>


        <p>During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the 
         cultures to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age" target="_blank">Iron age</a> ones. <sup>[87]</sup> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas" target="_blank">Vedas</a>  the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,<sup>[88]</sup>  were composed during this period, <sup>[89]</sup> and historians have analysed these to posit a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedic_period" target="_blank">Vedic culture</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punjab_region" target="_blank">Punjab Region</a> and the upper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Gangetic_Plain" target="_blank">Gangetic plain</a> <sup>[87]</sup>  Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.<sup>[88]</sup> The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caste_system" target="_blank">caste system</a>  which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.<sup>[90]</sup> On the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Plateau" target="_blank">Deccan pleateau</a> archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation. <sup>[87]</sup> In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_India" target="_blank">South india</a>,  a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,<sup>[91]</sup> as well as by nearby traces of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture" target="_blank">agriculture</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrigation_tanks" target="_blank">irrigation tanks</a>, and craft traditions.<sup>[91]</sup></p>

         <>
            In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahajanapadas" target="_blank">mahajanapadas</a>.<sup>[92][93]</sup> The emerging urbanisation gave rise to non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism" target="_blank">jainism</a> came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahavira" target="_blank">Mahavira  </a>.<sup>[94]</sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism" target="_blank">Buddhism</a>, based on the teachings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha" target="_blank">Gautama buddha</a> , attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.<sup>[95][96][97]</sup> In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal, <sup>[98]</sup> and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magadha" target="_blank">Magadha</a> had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurya_Empire" target="_blank">Mauryan empire</a><sup>[99]</sup> The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.<sup>[100][101]</sup>
            The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharma_(Buddhism)" target="_blank">dharma</a> <sup>[102][103]</sup>

            <h2>Governmentt</h2>
            <blockquote>Main articles: Government of India and Constitution of India</blockquote>

            <p>India is a federation with a parliamentary system governed under the Constitution of India—the country's supreme legal document. It is a constitutional republic.Federalism in India defines the power distribution between the union and the states. The Constitution of India, which came into effect on 26 January 1950<sup>[224]</sup> originally stated India to be a "sovereign, democratic republic;" this characterisation was amended in 1971 to "a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic".<sup>[243]</sup>  India's form of government, traditionally described as "quasi-federal" with a strong centre and weak states, has grown increasingly federal since the late 1990s as a result of political, economic, and social changes.<sup>[245][246]</sup></p>

            <p>The Government of India comprises three branches:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Executive: The President of India is the ceremonial head of state,<sup>[251]</sup> who is elected indirectly for a five-year term by an electoral college comprising members of national and state legislatures.The Prime Minister of India is the head of government and exercises most executive power.<sup>[254]</sup> Appointed by the president,<sup>[255]</sup> the prime minister is by convention supported by the party or political alliance having a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament.<sup>[254]</sup> The executive of the Indian government consists of the president, the vice president, and the Union Council of Ministers—with the cabinet being its executive committee—headed by the prime minister. Any minister holding a portfolio must be a member of one of the houses of parliament.<sup>[251]</sup></li>

                <li>Legislature: The legislature of India is the bicameral parliament. Operating under a Westminster-style parliamentary system, it comprises an upper house called the Rajya Sabha (Council of States) and a lower house called the Lok Sabha (House of the People).<sup>[257]</sup> The Rajya Sabha is a permanent body of 245 members who serve staggered six-year terms.<sup>[258]</sup> Most are elected indirectly by the state and union territorial legislatures in numbers proportional to their state's share of the national population.<sup>[255] </sup>All but two of the Lok Sabha's 545 members are elected directly by popular vote; they represent single-member constituencies for five-year terms.<sup>[259]</sup> </li>

                <li>Judiciary: India has a three-tier unitary independent judiciary<sup>[262]</sup> comprising the supreme court, headed by the Chief Justice of India, 25 high courts, and a large number of trial courts.<sup>[262]</sup> The supreme court has original jurisdiction over cases involving fundamental rights and over disputes between states and the centre and has appellate jurisdiction over the high courts.<sup>[263]</sup> It has the power to both strike down union or state laws which contravene the constitution<sup>[264]</sup> and invalidate any government action it deems unconstitutional.<sup>[265]</sup> </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Administrative divisions</h3>
            <blockquote><i>Main article: Administrative divisions of India</i></blockquote>
            <blockquote><i>See also: Political integration of India</i></blockquote>

            <p>India is a federal union comprising 28 states and 8 union territories.<sup>[13]</sup> All states, as well as the union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, Puducherry and the National Capital Territory of Delhi, have elected legislatures and governments following the Westminster system of governance. The remaining five union territories are directly ruled by the central government through appointed administrators. In 1956, under the States Reorganisation Act, states were reorganised on a linguistic basis.<sup>[266]</sup> There are over a quarter of a million local government bodies at city, town, block, district and village levels.<sup>[267]</sup></p>
